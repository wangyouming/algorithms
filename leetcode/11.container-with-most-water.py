# Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
#
# Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point
# at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints
# of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with
# x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
# 
# Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# 
# The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In
# this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is
# 49. 
#

# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right, width, res = 0, len(height)-1, len(height)-1, 0
        for w in range(width, 0, -1):
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                res, left = max(height[left]*w, res), left + 1
            else:
                res, right = max(height[right]*w, res), right - 1
        return res
