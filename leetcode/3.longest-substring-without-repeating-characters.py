# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3 
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
# ‚Å†            Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a
# subsequence and not a substring.
